Lazy imports facade for heavy third-party dependencies.

This module provides a centralized facade that lazily imports heavy dependencies
only when accessed, significantly improving import performance.

Usage:
    from data_designer.lazy_heavy_imports import pd, np, faker, litellm

    df = pd.DataFrame(...)
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    fake = faker.Faker()
